# ðŸ“± SMS Notifications Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ What I've Added

I've integrated SMS notifications into your braids booking system! Now customers will receive both email AND SMS confirmations when they book appointments.

### âœ… What's Been Created:

1. **SMS API Endpoint** (`/api/send-sms.js`) - Vercel serverless function for sending SMS
2. **Frontend SMS Service** (`frontend/src/services/smsService.ts`) - Handles SMS sending
3. **Combined Notifications** - Updated email service to send both emails and SMS
4. **SMS Templates** - Professional templates for different booking events

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### For Customers:
- **Email confirmation** with full booking details
- **SMS confirmation** with key appointment info
- **Professional messaging** with emojis and clear instructions

### For You (Eva):
- **Email notification** with customer details
- **SMS notification** with booking summary
- **Quick action buttons** to call or text customers

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Twilio Account
1. Go to [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com) and sign up for a free account
2. You get $15 free credit (enough for ~150 SMS messages)
3. Verify your phone number during signup

### Step 2: Get Twilio Credentials
1. In your Twilio Console, go to **Account** â†’ **API Keys & Tokens**
2. Copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**
3. Go to **Phone Numbers** â†’ **Manage** â†’ **Active Numbers**
4. Copy your **Twilio Phone Number** (starts with +1)

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to your **Vercel dashboard**
2. Select your **frontend project**
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number_here
EVA_PHONE_NUMBER=your_personal_phone_number_here
```

**Note:** 
- `EVA_PHONE_NUMBER` is optional - if you don't add it, you won't get SMS notifications
- Use format: `+1234567890` (include country code)

### Step 4: Deploy the SMS API
1. Copy the `api/send-sms.js` file to your Vercel project
2. Make sure it's in the `/api` folder
3. Redeploy your project

### Step 5: Update Your Booking Code (Optional)
If you want to use the new combined notifications, update your booking code to use:

```typescript
import { sendBookingNotifications } from './services/emailService';

// Instead of just sendBookingEmails, use:
await sendBookingNotifications(bookingData);
```
